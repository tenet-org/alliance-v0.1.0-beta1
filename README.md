# x/alliance interchain security

The Alliance module is part of the Interchain Security (Cosmos Shared Security that benefits from the IBC standard). Alliance is a friction free Interchain Security solution because there is no necessity to share hardware resources, have the blockchains synchronized nor modify the core of the origin chain that provide Interchain Security. Alliance module introduces the concept of alliance coins that can be seen as foreign coins bridged thru an IBC channel (ICS-004), whitelisted with the help of on-chain governance in the Alliance module and delegated by users or smart contracts to the active set of network validators.

Delegators of the alliance coins will be subjected to similar rules as the delegators of native coins but these delegators will provide Interchain Security to the network. The previously mentioned foreign coins can be in the form of Liquid Staked Derivative that benefits from the inflation of its native chain or any type of coin that can be bridged through the previously mentioned channels respecting the ICS-020 standard.

When users delegate coins through the Alliance module the voting power of the validators will be diluted, as a consequence, bad actors will have to increase their capital spendings to try and corrupt the consensus of the blockchain. 

By design, x/alliance use the following CosmosSDK modules to implement interchain security to a new or existing blockchain :

- [x/auth](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/auth/README.md),
- [x/bank](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/bank/README.md),
- [x/ibc](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#ibc-go),
- [x/staking](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/staking/README.md), 
- [x/distribution](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/distribution/README.md), 
- [x/gov](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/gov/README.md).

# Development environment
This project uses [Go v1.18](https://go.dev/dl/) and was bootstrapped with [Ignite CLI v0.24.0](https://docs.ignite.com/). 

To run the local development environment use:
```
$ ignite chain serve --verbose
```

If you want to build a binary ready to use:
```
$ ignite chain build
```

To build the proto files:
```
$ ignite generate proto-go
```

## Localnet 
Docker orchestration to create a local network with 3 docker containers:

- **localnet-start**: stop the testnet if running, build the terra-money/localnet-alliance image and start the nodes.
- **localnet-alliance-rmi**: removes the previously created terra-money/localnet-alliance image.
- **localnet-build-env**: delete and rebuild the terra-money/localnet-alliance
- **localnet-build-nodes**: using the terra-money/localnet-alliance starts a 3 docker containers testnet.
- **localnet-stop**: stop the testnet if running.

## Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/username/alliance@latest! | sudo bash
```
`username/alliance` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).

## Join Testnet
Joining the testnet is a very standardized process cosmos chain. In this case you will have to use **allianced** and follow [Terra documentation](https://docs.terra.money/full-node/manage-a-terra-validator/) since it's the same process but replacing it's genesis with the one that you can find in this repo under the path [docs/testnet/genesis.json](docs/testnet/genesis.json) and the following [seeds](http://3.75.187.158:26657/net_info),

### Running the simulation
The simulation app does not run out of the box since the alliance module owns all native stake. The `x/staking` module's operation.go file panics when a delegator does not have a private key.

In order to run the simulation, you can update the `x/staking` module directly before compiling the simulation app using the following command
```shell
go mod vendor
sed -i '' 's/fmt.Errorf("delegation addr: %s does not exist in simulation accounts", delAddr)/nil/g' vendor/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/staking/simulation/operations.go
ignite chain simulate
```
